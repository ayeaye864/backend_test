    <h2><u>About</u></h2>






    <h3><u>What is this website about?</u></h3>
    <h4>The Study Buddy website helps find other students nearby who are willing to study with others.
        It allows users to use their live location to search for nearby users in public areas and see what they are
        studying.
        If you'd like to join them, simply meet up in the location and study together! </h4>

    <h3><u>Is this safe?</u></h3>
    <h4>Yes, absolutely! We understand that sharing your live location online can be scary,
        but our website screens all users upon registering (feature not available for this project) to make sure that
        their
        information matches with public records.</h4>
    <h4>We also have an emergency SOS button should you feel uncomfortable at any point.</h4>

    <h3><u>Is studying together really effective?</u></h3>
    <h4>Yes! Many studies have shown that studying together boosts productivity, improves teamwork skills and helps you
        learn from each other.
        Group members may help you learn content through a different teaching style and you may have struggled with
        certain topics when learning independently.
        By teaching others, you also help reinforce your own learning. </h4>

    <h4>Some researchers may argue that independent study is more effective as you won't get distracted and meeting
        several people at the same time can be hard to schedule.
        However, our website is made to combat these problems as you meet like-minded people who are ready to learn.
    </h4>

    <h4>We also conducted our own long-term study into students' test scores when they studied individually and when
        they studied alone.
        We asked 500 students which method they preferred to study and split them into their respective groups.</h4>

    <p>Based on 500 students asked in Manchester aged 15-22</p>
    <h4>We found that studying in groups was more effective than independently and we made a product to facilitate group
        studying.</h4>
